the seven layers of network (the OSI Model) 

1- Application
2- presentation (convert data to undestandable,data compression, data encryption)
3- session 

4- Transport  (does three things) (segmentation, flow control , error control)
5- Network (logical addressing , routing )


6- Data Link (Provides node-to-node data transfer)
			The Data-Link Layer has two sublayers:

			- The first is the “medium access control,” which uses the MAC addresses from the network devices
			  to transmit data between them.
			
			- The second layer is the “logical link layer,” which identifies, checks flow control,
			  and performs the error check for the transmitted data.

7- physical  (transmission and reception of raw binary data over a communication medium:
              Cables, fiber optics, wireless transmission)

              The Physical layer defines the interface and mechanism for putting data bits on a network medium
              (cable, radio, or light). 




	what do we mean by topic in IOT or web servers ?
		Definition: A topic is a string that represents a channel or a category to which messages are published.
		Topics often have a hierarchical structure, which helps in organizing and filtering messages.
		
		Example: Consider a smart home setup. Topics might look like this:
		
		1- home/livingroom/temperature
		2- home/kitchen/humidity
		3- home/garage/doorstatus




what is message broker in AWS IOT core? 

1- In AWS IoT Core, the message broker is a key component that enables secure and efficient communication
  between IoT devices and the cloud.
2- The message broker routes messages from publishers (devices that send data)
  to subscribers (devices or services that receive data) based on topic subscriptions.

3- Practical Use Cases
	A- Real-time Data Processing:
	Devices send telemetry data (e.g., temperature readings) to the message broker, which then routes this data to backend services for real-time processing and analysis.

	B- Command and Control:
	Applications can send commands to devices via the message broker.
	For example, a smart home app can send a command to a thermostat to adjust the temperature.

	C- Device-to-Device Communication:
	Devices can communicate with each other indirectly through the message broker by publishing and subscribing
	to common topics.
	For example, sensors can send data to actuators via the broker.



what is the endpoint in AWS CORE IOT?

	The AWS IoT Core endpoint is a unique URL that acts as the entry point for IoT devices to communicate with AWS IoT Core.
	This endpoint allows devices to connect to the AWS IoT Core service and interact with the message broker,
	which facilitates the exchange of messages between devices and the cloud.
	
	Example Endpoint
	A typical endpoint URL might look like: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
	a1b2c3d4e5f6g7-ats (address of broker)
	a1b2c3d4e5f6g7 (mangment)
	This URL includes:
	1- Account-specific identifier: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7
	2- Type of endpoint: -ats (signifies that it uses Amazon Trust Services)
	3- Service and region: iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

Authentication Vs Authorization 

	- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a device or user.
	  It ensures that the entity trying to connect to AWS IoT Core is who it claims to be
	
	- Authorization is the process of determining what actions an authenticated device or user
	  is allowed to perform. It ensures that the entity has the necessary permissions to perform the requested actions.

	** Detailed Example
	Device A (Temperature Sensor):

	Authentication: Device A connects to AWS IoT Core using its X.509 certificate.
	AWS IoT Core verifies this certificate against its trusted CAs.
	
	Authorization: After successful authentication, AWS IoT Core checks the attached policy
	to determine if Device A is allowed to publish messages to the topic home/temperature/livingroom.



Filters are a way to subscribe to multiple topics in a single request.


Outgoing publishes are the MQTT messages that a client sends to the broker.
These messages are published to specific topics, and the broker then distributes these messages to any clients subscribed to those topics.

Incoming publishes are the MQTT messages that a client receives from the broker.
These messages are sent by the broker to the client because the client has subscribed to the topics on which these messages were published.
