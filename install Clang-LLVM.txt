2- install the clang-format VS-code extension.

3- make sure that you have successfuly installed LLVM/Clang through opening cmd/bash or any shell
   and type  " clang-format.exe --version " ,
   you should see the version you have already installed on your machine, otherwise you may did not install clang successfuly or the (.bin/cmake-format.exe) is not added to system paths.  

4- EDIT setting.json by adding this line : "clang-format.executable": "C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin/clang-format.exe"
	note that the previous direction is on my machine, pls make sure of typing you correct path.
	you may use this command in your shell " where clang-format.exe  " if you want to know where is the exactly installed location. 

5- go to setting of VS-code then in ( clang-format fallback style for C, type 'GNU')
